			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p>
				A churro is a cinnamon- and sugar-topped fried pastry dough stick with Spanish and Portuguese origins. Churros
				are
				similar to doughnuts, but they have ridges because they are piped out of a pastry bag. Because they are fried
				instead of baked, churros have a fluffy and tender interior with a satisfyingly crispy exterior.
